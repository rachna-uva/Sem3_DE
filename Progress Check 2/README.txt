Dear Students,

Please adhere to the following guidelines when preparing your assignment for submission:

1. Do Not Change Notebook Names:
   Ensure that you do not modify the names of any notebooks provided to you. This is crucial for the grading process.

2. Save and Submit LDA Models:
   All LDA models generated should be saved as you run the public tests. These models must be included in your final submission.

3. Do Not Delete Any Cells:
   The notebooks might contain empty cells which are placeholders for automatic tests. Deleting these cells will result in a loss of points.

4. Complete All Public Tests:
   It is mandatory to pass all public tests. Failure to do so will likely result in the hidden tests failing as well, meaning you will not receive points for either.

5. Submission Format:
   Submit your assignment as a .zip file containing all the necessary notebooks and your LDA models. Ensure the .zip file is correctly named and organized.

6. Do Not Include 'fake.csv':
   Please do not include the 'fake.csv' file in your submission. We already have this file and do not require multiple copies. Including it only increases the size of your submission unnecessarily.

Following these guidelines will ensure a smooth grading process and prevent any unnecessary loss of points.

Good luck!
