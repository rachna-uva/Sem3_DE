Dear Students,

Please adhere to the following guidelines when preparing your assignment for submission:

1. Do Not Change Notebook Names:
   Ensure that you do not modify the names of any notebooks provided to you. This is crucial for the grading process.

2. Do Not Delete Any Cells:
   The notebooks might contain empty cells which are placeholders for automatic tests. Deleting these cells will result in a loss of points.

3. Complete All Public Tests:
   It is mandatory to pass all public tests. Failure to do so will likely result in the hidden tests failing as well, meaning you will not receive points for either.

4. Submission Format:
   Submit only your notebook.

Following these guidelines will ensure a smooth grading process and prevent any unnecessary loss of points.

Good luck!
